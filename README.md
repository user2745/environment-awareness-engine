### **README: Physical Environment Integration**

---

#### **Overview**
The **Physical Environment Integration** capability makes Nova aware of the physical space using cameras and sensors. It processes real-time video feeds to detect objects, recognize activities, and generate contextual insights.

---

#### **Features**
- Real-time object detection using a camera feed.
- Activity recognition from video sequences.
- Aggregated environmental context for actionable insights.
- Supports live camera feeds and saved video analysis.
- Modular and extensible architecture.

#### **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/physical-environment-integration.git
   cd physical-environment-integration
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the System**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Commands**:
   - `analyze`: Analyze the environment and display insights.
   - `exit`: Save the system state and exit.

---

#### **Requirements**
- Python 3.8+
- Camera hardware (e.g., webcam).
- Pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5).
- `requirements.txt` dependencies:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `numpy`
  - `torch` (for YOLO)

---

#### **Next Steps**
- Replace placeholder models with your pre-trained YOLO or SSD.
- Extend activity recognition logic for complex scenarios.
- Integrate additional sensors (e.g., motion detectors) for enhanced context.
